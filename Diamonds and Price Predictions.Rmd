# Let's start by examining two variables in the data set.
# The scatterplot is a powerful tool to help you understand
# the relationship between two continuous variables.

# We can quickly see if the relationship is linear or not.
# In this case, we can use a variety of diamond
# characteristics to help us figure out whether
# the price advertised for any given diamond is 
# reasonable or a rip-off.

# Let's consider the price of a diamond and it's carat weight.
# Create a scatterplot of price (y) vs carat weight (x).

# Limit the x-axis and y-axis to omit the top 1% of values.
diamonds$volume <- with(diamonds, x*y*z)
ggplot(data = subset(diamonds, volume < quantile(volume, 0.99)), aes(x = carat, y = price))+
  geom_point()

#Right answer
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price))+
  geom_point(color = 'darkblue', alpha = 0.05)+
  xlim(0, quantile(diamonds$carat,0.99))+
  ylim(0, quantile(diamonds$price, 0.99))
#Another answer with qplot
qplot(data = diamonds, x = carat, y = price,
      xlim = c(0, quantile(diamonds$carat, 0.99)),
      ylim = c(0, quantile(diamonds$price, 0.99)))+
  geom_point(fill = I('#F79420'), color = 'black', shape = 21)
