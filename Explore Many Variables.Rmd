# Write code to create a new data frame,

# information on each age AND gender group.

# The data frame should contain the following variables:

#    mean_friend_count,
#    median_friend_count,
#    n (the number of users in each age and gender grouping)

# Here is an example of the structure of your data frame. Your
# data values will be different. Note that if you are grouping by
# more than one variable, you will probably need to call the
# ungroup() function.
