<h2>Abstract</h2>
I describe the effects that certain factors play over
<h2>Introduction</h2>
This data set was facilitated by Prosper


```{r}
#Subset data to exclude ambiguous employment status, top 1% earners 
#and bottom 1%
loans2 <- subset(loans, !(EmploymentStatus %in% c('','Not available','Other')))
loans2 <- subset(loans2, StatedMonthlyIncome<quantile(StatedMonthlyIncome, 0.99) 
                 & StatedMonthlyIncome>quantile(StatedMonthlyIncome, 0.01) )

#Creating data frame with means and medians for Loan Amounts
loan.loan_by_income <- loans2 %>%
  group_by(IncomeRange) %>%
  summarise(mean_loan_amount=mean(LoanOriginalAmount),
            median_loan_amount=median(LoanOriginalAmount),
            n=n())
ggplot(loan.loan_by_income, aes(x=IncomeRange,y=mean_loan_amount)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")

#Counts for Employment Status of data sample
ggplot(loans2, aes(x=EmploymentStatus)) +
geom_bar(fill = I('#4863A0')) +
geom_text(stat='count', aes(label=..count..), vjust=-0.5)

#Loan Amount by Monthly Income
ggplot(loans2, aes(x = StatedMonthlyIncome, y = LoanOriginalAmount))+
  geom_point(alpha=0.20, position=position_jitter())
